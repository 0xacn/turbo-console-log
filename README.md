I) Inserting meaningful log message automatically 

Two steps:

* Pressing Ctrl + alt + l in windows/linux Or Cmd + alt + l on a MAC

The log message will be inserted in the next line relative to the selected variable like this: 

console.log('SelectedVariableEnclosingClassName -> SelectVariableEnclosingFunctionName -> SelectedVariable', SelectedVariable)

The log message can be wrapped by changing the value of wrappLogMessage to true in setting.json
